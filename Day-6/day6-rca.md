Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Notes

    Symptom: Multiple HL7 parse failure alerts have been recorded in the system.

    Initial Findings:

        The alerts are linked to specific patient records (patient_id), indicating potential issues with HL7 messages related to these patients.

        Recent alerts occur at distinct timestamps but show a pattern that can help narrow down system events or data inputs causing failures.

    Potential Causes:

        Malformed HL7 messages or segments causing the parser to fail.

        Data entry errors or inconsistencies from source systems generating HL7 feeds.

        Timing or network issues causing incomplete or corrupted message delivery.

    Next Steps for Investigation:

        Review HL7 message content for parse failure alerts (requires logging or message capture).

        Cross-check with source system logs during the timestamps noted for failures.

        Monitor network traffic for anomalies or retransmissions.

        Confirm whether patient data in the EMR aligns with HL7 message fields.

    Mitigation Suggestions:

        Enhance HL7 interface validation and error logging.

        Establish alerts on parse failures to trigger automated investigation workflows.

        Train upstream data teams on correct HL7 message formats and error prevention.
