# Day 9 - Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

## Overview
This document summarizes the findings from analyzing the device heartbeat logs for errors.

## Error Types Observed
- low-battery
- sensor-fault
- comm-failure

## Error Summary

- **low-battery**: Occurred frequently, indicating some devices may have insufficient power management.
- **sensor-fault**: Appeared intermittently, possibly due to faulty or miscalibrated sensors.
- **comm-failure**: Less frequent, likely related to network issues or signal interference.


## Root Cause Hypotheses

- Devices reporting low battery might have aging batteries or insufficient charging cycles.
- Sensor faults could stem from hardware defects or environmental factors affecting sensor accuracy.
- Communication failures might be caused by network instability or physical obstructions.

## Next Steps / Recommendations

- Implement battery health monitoring and alerts.
- Investigate and replace faulty sensors.
- Improve network coverage or add retries for failed communications.
- Automate alerting when errors exceed thresholds.
