Day 6: PostgreSQL Setup and HL7 Alert Analysis
What I Did

    Installed PostgreSQL on my Windows machine and configured the system PATH to use psql from Git Bash.

    Created a new database called hl7db and connected to it using the psql command-line interface.

    Verified the database schema contained two tables: alerts and patients.

    Ran SQL queries from day6-queries.sql to analyze HL7 alerts and patient data.

    Explored how alerts correlate with patient information by joining the two tables.

Challenges Faced

    Initially received an error that the hl7db database did not exist; resolved this by creating the database.

    Realized the schema file was empty, so I ensured the correct schema with tables was loaded before running queries.

    Learned to use \i in psql to run SQL scripts directly.

    Understood the need to check table existence and structure before running SELECT queries.

What I Learned

    How to connect and interact with PostgreSQL using the command line.

    Basic database commands like listing tables (\dt) and describing table structure (\d).

    Writing and running SQL queries to filter, join, and aggregate data.

    How to analyze HL7 alert data by patient using SQL joins, filtering by alert types, and ordering results.

    Useful SQL commands like ORDER BY, LIMIT, GROUP BY, and JOIN.

Summary of Findings

    Successfully retrieved the latest 10 HL7 parse failure alerts along with patient details.

    Noted that each patient currently has one alert associated with them.

    Demonstrated how alert data can be linked to patients for effective root cause analysis and monitoring.
