# VPN and Secure Connectivity Basics in Healthcare

## What is a VPN?
A **Virtual Private Network (VPN)** creates a secure, encrypted tunnel between a userâ€™s device and a hospital network. This allows remote access to sensitive healthcare systems as if the user were on-site.

## Why is VPN Important?
- Protects **Protected Health Information (PHI)** by encrypting data in transit.
- Enables secure remote access to EMR/EPIC and other healthcare applications.
- Prevents unauthorized access and data interception, especially over public networks.

## Common VPN Protocols
- **IPSec**: Used for site-to-site VPNs, encrypts IP packets for secure network communication.
- **SSL/TLS**: Used for remote access VPNs, secures specific applications or portals via web browsers.

## How VPNs Protect Health Data
- Encrypt data to keep it confidential.
- Authenticate users to ensure only authorized access.
- Maintain data integrity, preventing tampering.
- Control access permissions based on user roles.
