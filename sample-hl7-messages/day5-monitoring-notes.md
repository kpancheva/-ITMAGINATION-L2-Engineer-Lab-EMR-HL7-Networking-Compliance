# Day 5 – Cloud Monitoring & Alert Simulation

---

## Error Log Example


### 📌 What Happened
- The monitoring system detected an **HL7 parse failure**.
- The `PID` segment (Patient Identification) was **missing** from the HL7 message.
- This prevents proper patient identification and could stop the message from being processed in the EMR.

### 🔍 Possible Causes
1. **Device / Integration Engine Misconfiguration**  
   - The sending system may not be including the `PID` segment in the message template.
2. **Message Truncation**  
   - Network issues or interface errors could have cut the message short.
3. **Incorrect HL7 Version or Event Type**  
   - Some messages (e.g., ACKs) don't have a PID, but this was likely an ADT or ORM that should have had one.

### 🛠 Steps to Investigate
- **Check raw message** in Mirth logs to confirm if `PID` is missing entirely or malformed.
- **Review source system configuration** (device, lab system, etc.) to ensure PID segment is included in its HL7 mapping.
- **Test sending a sample message** from the source to see if the problem repeats.
- **Validate HL7 schema** using an HL7 validation tool.

### 🚑 Impact
- Messages without `PID` cannot be linked to a patient record.
- Downstream systems (e.g., EMR) will reject or ignore these messages.
- Could cause delays in patient care if orders/results are blocked.

### ✅ Preventive Actions
- Add monitoring rule to **alert immediately** on missing critical segments.
- Work with vendor/system admin to enforce **mandatory PID segment** in message generation.
- Implement **unit tests** for HL7 message formats in integration engine.
