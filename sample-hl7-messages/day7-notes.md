# Day 7 Notes â€” HL7 Message Parsing

## What I did
- Created a Python script to parse HL7 message files.
- Initially split the message into segments and fields.
- Enhanced the parser to handle repeating fields (using `~`) and components within fields (using `^`).

## How the parsing works
- The HL7 message is made of segments separated by newlines (`\n`).
- Each segment starts with a segment name (e.g., `MSH`, `PID`) followed by fields separated by pipes (`|`).
- Some fields contain multiple repetitions separated by `~`.
- Each field or repetition can further contain components separated by `^`.

## Why this matters
- Healthcare systems rely on HL7 messages to exchange structured patient and event data.
- Correctly parsing these nested elements is essential to accurately understand and process the message contents.

## Challenges
- Handling multiple levels of separators (segment, field, repetition, component).
- Optional or empty fields that may cause empty strings or missing data.

## Next steps
- Use the parsed data to extract relevant clinical or administrative information.
- Possibly convert parsed data into database records or JSON for easier downstream processing.
